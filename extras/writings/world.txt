“World”

I live as free as I please, and I don’t need to appease,
all ‘em fuckers out there who want me dead as can be.
They say “The Land of The Free”, oh please, don’t even tease.
You’re a liar and a cheat, a fuckin’ scandal off the streets.

Commitin’ crimes late at night, undercover, dodgin’ lights.
Kataclysm rippin’ rhymes, listen closley, open eyes.
Threw his heart out with a lie, reaching high to the sky.
All these people want him dead, it ain’t hard to see why.

Crooks be workin’ on a scheme, it doesn’t put you at ease.
Believe me, the thing’s I’ve seen? Make me nauseous and green.
Authorities don’t hear our pleas, knockin’ people off their feet.
Pullin’ people off the streets because they’re darker than me.

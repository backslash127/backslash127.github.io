						<header>1st semester</header>
						<hr>

						<p>the first semester of school has ended. how was it? eh, idk it was alright i guess. unfortuately i did fail one of my classes and i'll be needing to make up the lost points for that.</p>
						<p>school is tough and i swear i had it this semester but i hadnt apparently. maybe once i make up those points and the next semester starts i'll be able to pick myself back up and do better.</p>
						<p>i've always had a hard time making it through school honestly and failing a class really isn't the most surprising thing to me. it definitely sucks though, that teacher is relentless and frankly kinda rude?</p>
						<p>the class i had was full of people that typically mess around and arent very productive. (which isn't saying a lot because that can describe most classes i have) but the teacher seemed to enjoy reminding the class how unproductive we were. always comparing us to their other classes and telling us how good they are and how we werent. like, cmon thats not cool that's just mean.</p>
						<p>just checked my schedule, i do have this teacher next year which sucks a LOT. i could try to ask for a new teacher but i'm not sure if admins will appreciate a last minute schedule alteration. the next semester starts on monday (today is saturday).</p>
						<p>i'm sure i'll be fine? iunno i'm just gonna have to deal with an unnecessarily rude teacher for a little while longer.</p>

						<header>i fuckin' love piracy</header>
						<hr>
						
						<p>recently i've been cookin' up some really good looking art and that was all thanks to my decision to pirate adobe illustrator.</p>
						<p>graphic design n other adjacent stuff like that has always been fun to me. there's something about it i find more intuitive than drawing. i think it might be the lack of redoing and undoing a vurpxillion times for one brush stroke just for it to still look a little weird.</p>
						<p>i still adore drawing though so i shouldn't be talking bad about it like that lol.</p>
						<p>adobe illustrator is very nice but obviously its sometimes a pain in the dick to use because... well- it's an adobe product, duh.</p>
						<p>i take this graphic arts class at school and they provide me an adobe account with a subscription which i appreciate but i wanna keep this program forever! i don't wanna just lose it as soon as im out of school.</p>
						<p>most of the time i can deal with the headaches that adobe causes so it's really not a huge deal, and in return i get to be proud of myself for making something that looks really freakin' awesome!</p>

						<header>remember when i said i wouldn't remake the website again</header>
						<hr>

						<p>i don't even have an excuse for this one.</p>
						<p>i remade the website again, for like, the 6th time... maybe the 8th time? i wouldn't know i lost count.</p>
						<p>why? fuck if i know LMAO. i always feel like i could improve on my skills with web development and cleaning up my website makes me feel better.</p>
						<p>and!!! and!! and!!! i do actually notice improvement. i'm being more efficient with my code, i'm organizing files better, and i'm even using some Javascript here and there made from scratch! (not like the, the uhm the game development website)</p>
						<p>i always like seeing how far i can go with my abilities, and i would say i've done pretty well with this. everything looks nicer and i've eliminated most of the weird hacky techniques i was using before to acomplish certain things.</p>
						<p>can i guarantee that i won't rewrite the website again? no. don't be surprised when in a few months you end up reading another blogpost about how i cleaned up the website again.</p>

						<header>summer break wow!!! i'm so free..</header>
						<hr>

						<p>summer break just started for me and i've been enjoying myself. not needing to worry about schoolwork is such a great feeling.</p>
						<p>i passed all my classes this semester so i don't need to do more summer schooling. woohoo yaaayy i'm so awesome i did it</p>
						<p>speaking of which, i start my summer school on the 10th for a class i failed the previous semester(?). that sucks pretty bad but, i can't imagine it'll be too grueling.</p>

						<header>what else have i been up to?</header>
						<hr>

						<p>uhmm hmmm lemme think... not a whole lot?</p>
						<p>for like the last couple of months i've been obsessed with this Roblox game called <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/127196404987615/" target="_blank">Shellbound</a>.</p>
						<p>if you like the semi-methodical parry-based combat of games like Deepwoken (ew) then you should give it a shot. the learning curve is a bit steep but the game is fun. the community kinda smells though so i'd stay away for the most part.</p>
						<p>i finished Minecraft Story Mode season 1, but i already made a post about that earlier so i won't tell you about it. i just started season 2 and man i remember when it first came out. it was so crazy to hear about season 2 releasing after everyone had mostly forgotten about MCSM at that point.</p>
						<p>admittedly, from what i remember, the plot of season 2 is kinda meh in comparison to season 1. doesn't mean it's bad though! not at all, but it was clearly meant to be just a little intermittent adventure to act as a bridge into whatever Telltale had planned for season 3, but we all know what happened not too long after they releaseed season 2... oops.</p>
						<p>apparently Telltale got bought by some other company and that company like, kinda revived it? so the chances of MCSM season 3 being made have exponentially increased. i'm not getting my hopes up though really, Telltale had a pretty rough history even before MCSM so i'm not sure what their next move would be. i don't even think they'd have the rights to make another MCSM so they'd need to gather their paperwork together first.</p>
						<p>oh! oh! oh! i almost forgot but i've been working on an MSPFA!</p>
						<p>whats an MSPFA..? uhm it's like, a webcomic in the format of like, homestuck n' shit... idk... if you have no idea what i'm talking about then you don't need to read the rest of the blogpost.</p>
						<p>anywho, yeah i've been working on an MSPFA it's called <a href="https://mspfa.com/?s=63351" target="_blank">FAUX</a> and it's super awesome i promise. please give it a read if you're interested!</p>
						<p>aaaaand i think that's everything really. thank's for reading byebye</p>

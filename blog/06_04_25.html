						<hr>

						<p>you have no idea what i've been up to recently.</p>
						<p>at the time i'm writing this (06/04/25 - 11:21PM) i just got done with Episode 8 of Minecraft: Story Mode.</p>
						<p>this game, is amazing.</p>
						<p>i've always had a sweet spot for MCSM for years, but weirdly enough i never actually played the whole thing myself?</p>
						<p>simple youtube playthroughs do NOT give this game enough justice. the whole experience feels great when you actually get to experience it the way Telltale intended.</p>
						<p>i honestly can't decide if i like the witherstorm plot or the portal hallway plot more. if i were to choose now, i'd probably say the witherstorm was better, but the portal hopping was awesome too.</p>	
						<p>that whole, i guess first act or whatever really feels like a whole story. a group of goofballs saving the whole world from a horrifying nightmare monster. the portal hall plotline was also great!</p>
						<p>the whole concept of the portals really opened the whole thing up to LITERALLY ANYTHING. a skyblock city ruled by a harsh, almost dictator-like figure, murder mystery mansion with uhm- youtubers..? okay, rogue AI taking control of an entire civilization, and... minigames?</p>
						<p>honestly a shame that the portal plotline only spans 4 episodes because there was so much potential for more, though i suppose after a while it could've gotten a bit stale.</p>
						<p>the entirety of MCSM is genuinely such a fun experience, even if it's pretty linear, there's still opportunity for variation that make your playthrough differ from someone else's.</p>
						<p>sure, it's corny and cheesy at moments, but c'mon this game released in... what? 2015??? it turns 10 years old this year cut it some slack lol. it also doesn't adhere to minecraft too well at times, but most of the time those moments are ignorable. if they're not? well you can just kinda laugh it off and keep playing, none of them are dealbreakers that make you wanna quit.</p>
						<p>it's definitely got some other issues too, i noticed plenty of visual and auditory bugs throughout my playthrough.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<header><p>game is a buggy mess? kinda?</p></header>
						<hr>

						<p>okay so SURELY i'm not the only person who's noticed the genuine like, degradation of this game? if you watch any old playthroughs of MCSM you really don't see any bugs, visual or otherwise, but nowadays theres plenty of issues. weirdly compressed/incorrect textures (specifically on characters), voicelines being cut off or misused? (i heard the male jesse voice used like twice when i was playing as the female jesse lol), and a handful more.</p>
						<p>i have never in my life seen a game functionally break down like this over time, what the fuck even happened??? how does a game straight up just, decompose like that? is MCSM like a lossy file format???? will every copy of MCSM eventually become unplayable buggy messes in like 12 years??? what black magic fuckery did Telltale do to make the game do that in the first place????</p>
						<p>maybe it's actually always been buggy as hell like this and i never actually noticed... ouh i might need to binge some old MCSM playthroughs now actually just to see. no no no i'll do that, either super later or never.</p>

						<header><p>on a completely unrelated note:</p></header>
						<hr>

						<p>i've been working on a website rewrite/refresh for a while now.</p>
						<p>I KNOW!!! i said this was the last one but frankly the way this one's code is structured is, fuckin' atrocious LMAO</p>
						<p>stay tuned!! you'll never know when i'll be done with it!!! or if i'll ever be done with it!!!! just wait and see....</p>
						<p>anywho that's all thanks for reading :3</p>

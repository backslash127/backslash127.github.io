                <p>"...i'm doing the, same shit."</p>
                <p>y'know i don't typically write blogposts in the morning, but it's the weekend and i've got things on my mind.</p>
                <p>what kinda things? i'm not actually sure. i just know i got them, and i gotta get them out.</p>
                <p>i've been pretty exhausted lately, what with all the crazy happenings that have been going on in my life recently. all of its kinda manifested in a general exhaustion and demotivation to do a bunch of things.</p>
                <p>"that kinda sounds like depression" i hear myself say, and yes! it probably is. i guess i'm not too worried, i've felt like this before and have actually felt worse in the past. i think i'm just a bit burnt out really, but unfortunately i ain't getting many moments to breathe.</p>
                <p>this semester started out... pretty bad... failing three classes as i write this blogpost and i'm realizing now i should probably be doing the work for those classes i'm failing isntead of doing this.</p>
                <p>too late! i've got some momentum going here, i'm not gonna let it go to waste.</p>
                <p>school really just... sucks, a lot. it upsets me that i'm forced to be in such a shitty system honestly! but what else am i supposed to do? i was thinking about dropping out a little bit ago, but i'm realizing now that would probably just make things worse.</p>
                <p>it's tough. i notice every time i <em>do</em> have days off from school, i'm not really... doing anything with said time. then that makes me imagine what it'd be like if EVERY day was a day off from school! i don't wanna sit around doing nothing forever! that's sounds so miserable.</p>
                <p>but then i think, "i'd have freedom to do whatever i want! i can be who i want to be!" and it just complicates things more. would i really use that freedom to do what i want? or will i spend it all fossilizing in bed?</p>
                <p>you would think i'd know myself well enough to know how to answer that question, but i really don't. i feel like i've reached a huge transitional period in my life where i have absolutely zero idea where life will lead me. really, it's almost felt like that my entire life! i barely even know myself, and at moments i know myself a little more, and at moments i have no idea who i even am.</p>
                <p>life is a strange strange thing, but it's beautiful. it's brutal, it's messy, and it doesn't pull its punches.</p>
                <p>but it's still the best thing to ever happen to me.</p>

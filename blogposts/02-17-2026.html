                <h2>oops sorry i died for almost half a year</h2>
                <hr>

                <p>ouuhhkaay... this is a little awkward. nah i'm kidding, it's not. welcome back!!! though i guess it'd make more sense if i was the one being told that.</p>
                <p>doesn't matter. anyways, when was the last blogpost? fuckinnnnn' uhm- 5 months ago? goddamn! yeah sorry about that i've been busy, kinda? if living life and doing nothing else counts as being busy then yeah, i've been busy.</p>
                <p>i still can't decide whether or not i wanna even <em>try</em> to explain all that's happened since the last blogpost and this one, and frankly, i don't even rememeber all of it. i suppose i'll just go over the highlights, and other stuff i barely rememeber.</p>
                <p>firstly, i reconnected with a bunch of old friends i hadn't really talked to for a while.</p>
                <p>then, i started dating one of said old friends, she was real cool, we dated for about 4 months, it was nice.</p>
                <p>a little into our relationship, i played on a minecraft server she was hosting with a few of her other friends and some of my old friends, it was a bit of a mess but it was still fun.</p>
                <p>then, that server ended, and then me and her worked together to start up a new one that we were hoping would go smoother than the last server. and it did mostly! that server eventually died out though unfortunately, but it was still great at its peak.</p>
                <p>during the life of the new server, things got a bit messy between me and her, and the two of us eventually broke up... for like a week... and then we got back together.</p>
                <p>i don't remember if this was before or after that happened, but i started HRT, and as of writing this blogpost, i've been on it for 3 months!</p>
                <p>a little time goes by, and then we break up again, for real. that sucked, it hurt a bit but we still stayed friends and kept in touch. things were nice again for a little while there, but then i fucked up, really really bad, and it led to me and her parting ways completely.</p>
                <p>along with me and her parting ways, i also left all the other friends that were part of that general group too...</p>
                <p>...and that all leads up to now.</p>
                <p>the last 5 months have been the most eventful, complicated, and strange months i've ever experienced. as of right now, things kinda suck honestly, really bad. i'm trying to keep my chin up though. trying to move on, without her, and everyone else.</p>
                <p>i'm not really sure what compelled me to update my website again, i guess i was just looking for an excuse to keep myself busy and distract myself? i don't know the exact reason, but it's nice to get to make something im proud of again.</p>

                <h2>alright let's talk about recent times</h2>
                <hr>

                <p>i can't really think of much to talk about? at least i can say that i've spent a lot of time crying, reasonably so, but i'll be alright.</p>
                <p>oh right, my birthday happened last month, i went out with my family to get sushi for dinner. i had a good time, and the food was amazing. sushi has always been a favorite of mine since like... forever!</p>
                <p>maybe a couple months before that? we got a dog. her name is missy and she's really small and cute! she's really nervous right now, but i hope she warms up to everything eventually.</p>
                <p>oh... and just a couple days ago one of our cats, freddy, had to be put down. we only had him around in the house for like, a year maybe, but before then he lived with my gramma at her own place for a while. he was a really great cat, he was really funny but incredibly sweet too.</p>
                <p>i'm gonna miss him a lot, even if i didn't really know him for that long.</p>
                <p>...and here i am now, writing this blogpost on my website. things have been rough, but i'll be alright, eventually. thanks for stopping by to read all of this, i really appreciate it!</p>
